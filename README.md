Dan should learn Julia and also make a chess engine to defeat Matt K. This is phase two of bringing Matt K down in Elo on chess.com. This bot will not likely ever be finished, but Dan is so annoyed by blundering so many free pieces that he's making this project and developing a multi-phase approach to bringing down Matt K.
